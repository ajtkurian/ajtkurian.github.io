	<h2>Why I created This Page</h2>
	<p>
	I felt that I needed to express my fandom for such an "iconic" player as Austin Rivers.  Other stars have pages like <a href="http://lebronjames.com/">Lebron James</a> where they highlight the superaltives of that player with glitz and glam using CSS and so many html tags like (div, sections, links, images) in order to customize the site in line with the player's standing in basketball.  That site in particular is organized and sends a clear message of what Lebron represents in life and basketball.  My barely functioning site is also a true reflection of what Austin Rivers represents: a player that barely functions in the NBA.
